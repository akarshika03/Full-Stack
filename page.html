    <p>A car, or an automobile, is a motor vehicle with wheels.
         Most definitions of cars state that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, 
         have four wheels, and mainly transport people, not cargo.[1][2] French inventor Nicolas-Joseph
          Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while French-born Swiss inventor Fran√ßois Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed
           the first internal combustion-powered automobile in 1808.</p>
